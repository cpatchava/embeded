#embeded


I have done the assignment like you had asked for on the board.

When i tried to follow your instructions and compile the hello world on my computer
i started getting errors on dependency with device.h file that did not exist
inside of the template.h which was included in mbed.h file. 

WRITING hw1.cpp took 10 minutes and figuring out what the assembly code was doing took 15 minutes.

I spent 2 hours trying to make the hw1_helloworld.cpp file work. I could not get it work because
of the dependency issue i labeled above. I downloaded the full library from:
http://developer.mbed.org/users/mbed_official/code/mbed/

and i tried to compile it into a ".s" file like you had instructed in lecture.

This did not work. 

I have done the rest of the stuff like you had asked. the hw1.S file contains the assembly code
as well as the explnation
